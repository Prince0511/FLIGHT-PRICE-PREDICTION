# Flight Price Prediction ✈️💰
This repository contains the code and resources for my Flight Price Prediction project. The project aimed to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting flight prices based on various features. 🚀📊

## Introduction 📝
The purpose of this project is to create an accurate and reliable flight price prediction model. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can analyze factors such as flight duration, departure time, airline, and other relevant features to forecast flight prices. 🛫💡

## Methodology 🔍🧪
To achieve our goal, we followed these steps:

### Data Collection 📈: 
We gathered a comprehensive dataset containing information about flights, including their prices and relevant features.

### Data Preprocessing 🧹: 
The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. We also performed feature engineering to extract meaningful insights.

### Model Selection 🤖: 
We explored various regression models, such as DecisionTreeRegressor, SVR, KNeighborsRegressor, LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor, AdaBoostRegressor, and GradientBoostingRegressor. These models were trained on the labeled dataset to identify the best performer.

### Model Training 🏋️‍♀️: 
The selected model underwent training using the labeled dataset. We split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

### Model Evaluation 📊: 
We assessed the model's performance on the testing set using evaluation metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared.

### Hyperparameter Tuning ⚙️: 
We fine-tuned the hyperparameters of the selected model to optimize its performance.

### Prediction on Unseen Data 🔮: 
Finally, we utilized the best-performing model to predict flight prices on unseen data, providing an accurate and reliable estimation of flight costs.
